# Guidebook to Tinn
Robert Lee, Friday 13th September, 2019. How lucky.

## Starting the Game

You can either:
* email the author of the game for a direct link to the web version
* download the Windows program tinn.exe (let me know if this works please!)
* download the source code and compile.

## Playing the game

### Concept

You play a bold and dangerous hero, questing for adventure.

You start off looking like this: @

You will move through dozens of areas of adventure, each presenting
traps, monsters and rewards. Most levels are connected with up-ramps
(<) and down-ramps (>).

To win the game, complete your quest objectives and then escape the
dungeon using the up-ramp on the first area of adventure.

### Character Creation

You start off by creating a character. You will be asked for your
handle (not your name), and to make various choices about your
character. Every choice will affect how your character starts.

Some suggestions for new players:
* Combat: The strongest fighter is Crusader of Y'k: aggression/cruelty/fire/troll/crusader
* Learning: The shopkeeper (of any path) starts with the Hitch-Hiker's
Guide, which is a great source of information about the game.
* Trap avoidance: If you find traps too hard, switch to the Thief
class, which pre-identifies most traps.

Suggestions for advanced players:
* Water-based characters can swim, which makes Sirens far more
dangerous.
* An unaligned character (choose "none of the above" repeatedly) will
be attacked by all monsters and unable to enter temples.
* The Unaligned Crusader quest is extremely difficult as you will need
to find aligned Holy Books or Rods before you can enter the temple.

### Objectives

Your character will get objectives, which you can view using the O
(letter-oh, not number-zero) option. Most objectives need you to go
right through the game to complete them, so new players shouldn't
worry about them.

Instead, set yourself achievable goals: learn to run away from
dangerous monsters, use equipment effectively, and equip your
character as best as you can.

### How well you are doing

You have a number of statistics (stats) to tell you about your character;
these are typically shown at the bottom of the screen.

All have values starting from 0; the maximum limit is shown as '**'.
Your stats can be reduced temporarily; if you drop an equipped weapon,
for example, your fighting ability will be reduced. This is indicated
by a prefix: "80/20" means that the maximum you have achieved is 20,
and you are currently at 80% of that (ie 16).

Most stats you want to get as high as possible, except for
Damage. Damage is how injured you are, and if it reaches 100%, it's
game over. So you want to increase your maximum damage, but avoid
increasing your current damage (wounding).

Damage heals gradually over time. You can speed this up by eating;
trolls eat rocks while humans and most other creatures eat fruit and
flesh. Note that trolls are made of rock, making trolls cannibalistic
(should you manage to kill one).

You can avoid damage by armour; equip it using (e): most armour is
sacrificial, meaning that the armour takes the damage instead of
you. Use (i) to view your inventory and check on the state of your
armour frequently. This will also tell you if you're carrying too much
to move quickly.

You can boost your defence and fighting stats by using (e) to equip
weapons and armour. Use (d) to drop items you don't want to keep
equipped.

### Moving and Fighting

Pressing the W, A, S and D keys moves your North, West, South and
East. If you try to move somewhere you can't (like a wall), or into a
trap, then you waste a move instead.

If you really want to move into a trap - perhaps there's something
useful in that pit - then you can hold down the Alt key (or toggle the
"force" button on the web interface) to insist on moving, but the trap
will still hurt you.

If you move into a monster, you will attack that monster. Many
monsters will attack you, steal your things, or otherwise annoy you,
even if you don't attack them first, but some are peaceful (this
depends on species and deity alignment). All monsters can be attacked,
and killing a monster gives a small chance of improving your stats.

Some monsters are tougher than others; as you get deeper into the game
and more experienced, harder monsters appear, in general. Don't be
afraid to run away.

## Notable things

### Alignment

Alignment plays a subtle part in this game, but it's useful to
understand it eventually. It's introduced here not because it is
particularly important, but because an explanation may help you
understand some subsequent entries in this guidebook.

All deities have an alignment. Many are elemental, many are kind or
aggressive, and so one. There are a great number of deities and
alignments in the game.

Shrines, Holy Rods, Holy Books, and all monsters are aligned each to
a religious path. Each path has exactly one deity, with the notable
exception of the path of Atheism, which has only a teapot.

The closer the deities are in the heavens, the greater the alignment
between their religious paths. This is called co-alignment: a path is
fully co-aligned only with itself, but two paths will be more or less
co-aligned with each other.


### Shrines

You can enter a shire of your own deity easily, and will be protected
from all attack.  Shrines of other deities will provide protection and
entry proportional to how much that deity likes you.

A deity will like you if you are partially co-aligned (all Earth
deities stick together, for instance), or (to a lesser extent) if a
deity who is partially co-aligned likes you. Carrying a holy item
(book or rod) of a deity will also allow you access to their shrine.

Attacking anything in a shrine is a bad idea.

Leaving food in a shrine, as an offering for the starving, is a good
idea, and you may be rewarded with blessings.

Taking food from a shrine is a bad idea, unless you are in fact starving.

TODO: blessings and cursings


### Hitch-Hiker's Guide

All shopkeepers start with a Guide. Consult it often; it may give more
information than inspecting the may with tooltips or the (/) key.

A blessed guide may be searched freely.


### Shopping Card

A shopping card provides access to shops.
Shops are dangerous to the poor, but greatly rewarding to the rich.
Shops use a bartering system.

Tip: shopkeepers always ask for more than their goods are worth, but
are willing to haggle. You cannot trade corpses.

All shops have an adjective, which may provide a clue as to the
services they provide. Services range from a complementary cup of tea,
to enchanting or damage-proofing your weapons and armour.

Tip: you can pick up things that are far too big to carry; bridges and
ships are especially valuable. (u)se your shopping card while carrying
something heavy, and you will always be able to pay your way.

Once you enter a shop, you can't leave without at least trying to buy
something. If you buy a service you can't pay for, you'll get an IOU
that must be paid off before you can go shopping again.

Tip: Shop-keepers start with a Guide (which is reasonably valuable) and
a shopping card. Consult the guide about shops before you go shopping.

### Rods, Sticks and Wands

Stylii are sticks for spelling with. All sticks have a magic power,
but must be enchanted (perhaps at a shop) before they can be used;
they then become wands. The same stick will always have the same
power.

Blessing a wand (or stick) turns it into a Holy Rod.
